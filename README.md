# Improved-convergence-of-PINVIT

This repo contains the MATLAB code to reproduce the numerical experiments described in [1]. The implementation relies on MATLAB packages [2, 3], which users need to download independently.

Run mainDDM1.m and mainAGMG1.m to generate tables about Behaviors of $\varphi$.

Run mainDDM2.m, mainAGMG2.m and mainMP.m to generate tables about empirical probability tests.
